# Case Study: The Virtual Travel Agency
- - - -
We consider here an ecosystem of services dedicated to support an employee when travelling for business purpose. The services must support the following features:
- Propose alternative flights for a given destination and a given departureTimestamp, ordered by price and based on travellers preferences (e.g., only direct flight, given max travel time);
- Propose alternatives hotels for a given destination and a given departureTimestamp, ordered by prices;
- Propose alternative car rentals at a given place and for a given duration;
- Submit a business travel (a description of the different tickets and/or hotel nights to buy) to a manager, and wait for approval;
- Send a summary of an approved business travel by email.
